# Amazon Clone using ReactJS — The Ultimate Guide

In this article, we will go in depth and make the Amazon Clone using React. We will also be using <strong>Firebase</strong> for Authentication, Database, Functions and Hosting.

Firebase is a great tool to get started with projects quickly. We will also be using <strong>HTML, CSS and React Context API</strong>. Please keep in mind, you need to have Visual Studio Code and NodeJS installed.

1. Open the terminal to install the React App in your folder
   1. CTRL + J
      1. `terminal npx create-react-app .`
         1. **npx** is a part of **npm (Node Package Manager)** except npx runs a remote script instead of installing it locally. This is done so that you always have the **latest version** of React installed in your project.

      2. `create-react-app` is the name of the remote script.
      3. **“.”** specifies that we want the script to make a React project in the **SAME FOLDER** and not make a new folder for it, if you had to make a new folder name, you could **just provide the name of folder instead of** “.”and it would make a folder for you.
